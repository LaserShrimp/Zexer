# Zexer

A little and simple shoot'em up, just for fun.

## HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN
- LINUX:
  * go to your terminal
  * use the 'make' to the root of the project
  * write './zexer', tap enter and here you go :)

- WINDOWS:
  * same as in the linux section but for now it's not available

## Notes
Musics (for now, all picked up on www.Pixabay.com, all free of use):
- ***Sexy Chillout Hip Hop Track - Come With Me*** by Keyframe_Audio
- ***Password Infinity*** by Evgeny_Bardyuzha
- ***Electronic Future Beats*** by QubeSounds

> These songs are not meant to be a part of the project eternally, but hanks to their creators.
